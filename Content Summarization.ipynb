From driving software development in large companies to maintaining thriving open source communities, we’re spending Women’s History Month with women leaders who are making history every day in the tech community. Erin Spiceland is a Software Engineer for SpaceX. Born and raised in rural south Georgia, she is a Choctaw and Chickasaw mother of two now living in downtown Los Angeles. Erin didn’t finish college—she’s a predominantly self-taught software engineer. In her spare time, she makes handmade Native American beadwork and regalia and attends powwows.\\nHow would you summarize your career (so far) in a single sentence?\\nMy career has been a winding road through periods of stimulation and health as well as periods of personal misery. During it all, I’ve learned a variety of programming languages and technologies while working on a diverse array of products and services. I’m a domestic abuse survivor and a Choctaw bisexual polyamorous woman. I’m so proud of myself that I made it this far considering where I came from.\\nWhat was your first job in tech like?\\nIn 2007, I had a three-year-old daughter and I was trying to finish my computer science degree one class at a time, all while keeping my house and family running smoothly. I found the math classes exciting and quickly finished my math minor, leaving only computer science classes. I was looking at about five years before I would graduate. Then, my husband at the time recommended me for an entry software developer position at a telecom and digital communications company.\\nWhen faced with the choice between an expensive computer science degree and getting paid to do what I loved, I dropped out of college and accepted the job. I was hired to work on internal tooling, and eventually, products. I did a lot of development on product front-ends, embedded network devices, and a distributed platform-as-a-service. I learned Java/JSP, Python, JavaScript/CSS, Node.js, as well as MyS'"
